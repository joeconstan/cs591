Intro to JavaScript
wanted a lightweight language for the browser, that is similar to java in terms of syntax.
was written in c++.

ecmascript
Node is a wrapper around the engine to allow it to run javascript (server-side) standalone. Now it's a backend programming language!

v8 is the server side js engine by google. written in c++. nodejs includes the v8 engine.
uses semicolons, thank god;
comments same as c++
dont use var with variables.

hoisting.

let and const are block scope. var is not. var gets hoisted.

null vs undefined
null - absence of value
undefined - value = undefined
loosely equivalent (==) but not ===

function syntax:


function adder(left, right){
	return left + right;
}
console.log(`${adder(30,12)}`);

the backticks mean that its an interpolated string. ie,  its not just text, pls evaluate the function for me you little compiler bitch.
it evaluates stuff in the {}.
